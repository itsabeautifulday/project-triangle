1. The expected number of levels will be approximately Log(n)
2. No it is not spread uniformly, for it to be spread uniformly, the probability that a node will have height h equal to 1/H. However in this case, because at every coin flip, there's 1/2 chance of increasing the node's level, the node's probability of being at height i will be 1/(2^i), and that is not equal to 1/H.
3.

pointer at level 4 from -infinity to +infinity
pointer at level 3 from -inf to 19 to 32 to 71
pointer at level 2 from 32 to 33 to 54
pointer at level 1 from 33 to 36 40 50

5. spent approximately 8 hours.
